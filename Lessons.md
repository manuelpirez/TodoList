# Session 1 Summary

That will do for now! :+1: In this article we already implemented most of our desired functionality. Our app can display, add, and delete to-dos, toggle their completed status, show how many of them are completed, and apply filters.

To recap, we covered the following topics:

-    Creating and using components
-    Turning static markup into a live template
-    Embedding JavaScript expressions in our markup
-    Iterating over lists using the {#each} directive
-    Passing information between components with props
-    Listening to DOM events
-    Declaring reactive statements
-    Basic debugging with console.log() and reactive statements
-   Binding HTML properties with the bind:property directive
-    Triggering reactivity with assignments
-    Using reactive expressions to filter data
-    Explicitly defining our reactive dependencies
